--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when building sources, special flags are used :
  -mtune=native
  -march=native

they produce binaries that run on the machine they have been built ONLY

It could be wise to allow image user creator/maintainer to specify which value
to use with these flags :
  - native == no portability to other archs,
  - generic == augmented portability
