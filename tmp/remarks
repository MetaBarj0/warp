when building sources, special flags are used :
  -mtune=native
  -march=native

they produce binaries that run on the machine they have been built ONLY

It could be wise to allow image user creator/maintainer to specify which value
to use with these flags :
  - native == no portability to other archs,
  - generic == augmented portability

scratch concept of docker looks promising but difficult to test at first glance
The bare minimum would be to include a 'sh' inside.
official busybox image is fine enough
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
testing an executable generated by gcc-8.2.0 into busybox container. Busybox is
statically linked and does not provide any dynamic loader.
Works great, at least, if needed shared libs are present and dynamic loader is
reachable at a standard location (/lib for instance)

For docker image provider, bootstrap necessitates as today busybox:1.29.2-musl
as well as alpine:3.8.
Further versions will be tested later when they will be released
