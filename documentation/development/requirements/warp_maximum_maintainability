This requirement is tied to the `warp_main_contributor` actor.

It is an open requirement that will live all along the `warp` development
process.

To guarantee a maximum maintainability for `warp`, the Acceptance Test Driven
Development approach will be adopted.

In summary :
- Define a requirement right before any development work
- Create one or more acceptance tests associated to that requirement
- Define `warp` architecture according to emitted requirements
- Ensure all `warp` features are covered by tests
- Ensure `warp` deployability is at its maximum efficiency
